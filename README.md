# crispy-nim
A misere version of nim!

This program is run by typing "python3 nim.py" in the terminal. It sets up a pile and gives instructions on how to play the game. 
This game is played between computer and the user. 
Each turn the user/computer removes either 1, 2, or 3 from the pile.
The main goal of the game is to make the opponenet remove the last 1 from the pile.

The program displays the current pile and stats after every turn.
It also manages to display score after every game and the final score when the program ends.

Enjoy crispy nim!
